Description: This R tool works by means of implementing a form of the Bradley-Terry model.
	This model trains on real-world tennis data, produces a GLM designed to predict whether a given player will win a match.  The parameters for this model then inform the pairwise comparison result.  The result is a probability representing the likelihood of a given player winning a matchup against a second given player.
